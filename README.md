# ManagedX.Display
ManagedX.Display is a .NET 4.5 class library providing access to GDI display adapters, monitors and display modes on Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 (10 to be tested).
Also implements DisplayConfig (not available on Windows Vista).

Features:
- Supports both x64 and x86 platforms (AnyCPU)
- 100% CLS-compliant
- Built taking into account code analysis suggestions (all rules enabled)
- Fully commented (Intellisense)
- Hand-written: special care has been taken to avoid duplicating types (ie: DXGI), thus increasing compatibility (and readability?)
